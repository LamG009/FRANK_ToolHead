 Note that im fairly new to CAD and have only been building custom toolheads for about a year or so now. that being said, i've been able to successfully install this on my printer with minimal post processing 
 required. 
This toolhead was designed to meet the design requirement of my printed which i call "Voron Frankenstein". I could not think of a cooler name for the tool head other than "FRANK" so that what im calling it for now lol. I've added all the step files to this repository and encourage anyone to iterate on this design to meet there specific build requirement.   
# Print_requirements 
 At this time, none of the stl files are oriented in optimal print positions sorry about that. you will need to orientate models to best suit your printer
 I followed the print requirements of the voron build for printed parts
